### What is docker?

⇒ **a software platform that allows developers to create, test, and deploy applications in containers**

. Containers are standardized units that contain everything an application needs to run, including code, libraries, and runtime.

### How does Docker Work?

- Docker provides a standard way to run code.
- Docker containers virtualize the operating system of a server.
- Docker containers are lightweight and can run on a single physical server.
- Docker containers can be shared between developers.
- Docker registries are repositories for Docker images.

**Benefits**

- Docker simplifies the development and delivery of applications.
- Docker allows developers to separate their applications from their infrastructure.
- Docker reduces the delay between writing code and running it in production.

**Use cases**

- Docker is used in microservices, continuous integration, and deployment.
- Docker can be used to build, ship, and run distributed applications at any scale.
